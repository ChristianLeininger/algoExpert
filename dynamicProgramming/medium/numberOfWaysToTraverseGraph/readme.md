## Number of Ways to Traverse a Grid 


This project provides a solution to the problem of calculating the number of distinct ways to traverse a grid from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner, moving only right and down. It includes both a combinatorial approach and a dynamic programming approach. 

### Description Given a grid of size `n x m`, the goal is to compute the number of ways to reach the bottom-right corner from the top-left corner by only moving right or down. -  **Combinatorial Approach**: Calculates the result using the binomial coefficient formula. -  **Dynamic Programming Approach**: Uses a table to iteratively compute the number of ways to reach each cell. 

Requirements  - Python 3.x 

Installation No additional installation is required. The standard Python library is sufficient to run the program and tests. 

To run the program:
```
python numberOfWaysToTraverseGraph.py
```
To run the test:
```
python -m unittest tests.py
```
