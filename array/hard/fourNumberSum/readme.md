# FourSum Target  
## Description This repository contains the solution for the FourSum Target problem. 
### Problem Statement The FourSum Target problem is a problem in computer science that involves finding all unique quadruplets in an array that sum up to a target value. Given an array of integers and another integer target, the task is to find all unique quadruplets in the array which gives the sum of the target. 
### Example For instance, consider the following example: 
* Example input input_array = [1, 0, -1, 0, -2, 2] target = 0 
* Expected output output = [[-2, -1, 1, 2], [-2, 0, 0, 2], [-1, 0, 0, 1]]
