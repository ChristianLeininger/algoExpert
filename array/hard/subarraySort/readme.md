# subarraySort 
 ## Description This repository contains the solution for the subarraySort problem. 
 ### Problem Statement The subarraySort problem involves finding the smallest subarray within an array that, if sorted, would result in the entire array being sorted.    
Given an array of integers, the task is to find the indices of the first and last integers of the smallest subarray that needs to be sorted. If the array is already sorted, the function should return [-1, -1]
