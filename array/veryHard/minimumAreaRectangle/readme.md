# Min Rectangle Area

## Problem Description

Given a set of points in a two-dimensional space, represented by x and y coordinates, we need to find four points that form a rectangle and have the minimum area.

Specifically, we aim to find points P1, P2, P3, and P4, such that:

1.  P1 and P2 share the same y-coordinate.
2.  P1 and P3 share the same x-coordinate.
3.  The y-coordinate of P3 is the same as the y-coordinate of P4.
4.  The x-coordinate of P2 is the same as the x-coordinate of P4.
