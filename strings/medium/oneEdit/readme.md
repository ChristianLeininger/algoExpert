# The One Edit Problem  
 Problem Statement The One Edit Problem is a common question in coding interviews. <br />
The problem is formulated as follows: Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away. <br /> 
An edit operation can be one of the following: <br />
 - Insert a character  <br />
 - Delete a character <br /> 
 - Replace a character <br /> 
 ## Solution Approach The One Edit Problem can be solved by iterating through the strings and comparing their characters. Depending on the lengths of the two strings, we perform different checks: 1. If the lengths of the strings differ by more than 1, return false. 2. If the lengths of the strings are the same, check if there is more than one character difference. 3. If the lengths differ by 1, check if the remaining characters after the differing one in the longer string are the same as the remaining characters in the shorter string. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the shorter string. <br />
 ## Example Let's take an example where the two strings are `pale` and `bale`. In this case, only one character differs (the first character 'p' in the first string and 'b' in the second string). All the other characters are the same, and the lengths of the strings are also the same. Therefore, these two strings are one edit away.
